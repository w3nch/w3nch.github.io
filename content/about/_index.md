## Who am I ?

I’m **w3nch**, a security-focused learner working through CTFs, labs, and real-world attack surfaces to understand how systems actually break, how to fix , and stop attacks before they happen.

## Interests

I’m currently interested in:

- Offensive security & blue-team investigations  
- CTF writeups (forensics, crypto, web, networking, malware analysis)  
- Linux internals & tooling  
- Automation, scripting, and analysis  
- Windows active directory and sysmon analysis

## About this site

This site exists as a place for:

- Writeups  
- Notes  
- Experiments  
- Things I don’t want to forget  

Minimalism is intentional — clarity over noise.
