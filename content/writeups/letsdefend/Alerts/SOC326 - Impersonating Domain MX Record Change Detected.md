**Event ID:** 304  
**Rule Name:** SOC326 – Impersonating Domain MX Record Change Detected  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Category:** Brand Protection / Phishing  
**Event Time:** September 17, 2024 – 12:05 PM  
**Impacted Asset:** LETSDEFEND

## Background

Sometimes attackers don’t kick the door down — they quietly make a copy of your house key first.

In this case, the threat actor registered a **look-alike domain** and configured email infrastructure before launching a phishing campaign. What initially appeared to be an _early warning_ quickly escalated into **active exploitation**, resulting in a user clicking a malicious link and communicating with attacker-controlled infrastructure.

## 1. Alert Overview

The alert was generated by **Digital Risk Protection** after detecting a **Mail Exchange (MX) record change** on a suspicious domain closely resembling the legitimate **letsdefend.io** domain.

The impersonating domain **letsdefwnd[.]io** (typosquatting via character substitution: _e → w_) was configured with a valid mail server (**mail.mailerhost.net**), strongly suggesting preparation for email-based phishing.

At the time of alert creation, no confirmed phishing email had yet been identified.

## 2. Detection & Verification

Initial triage involved reviewing the notification email received by the SOC:

- **Sender:** no-reply@cti-report.io
- **Recipient:** soc@letsdefend.io
- **Email Content:** Informational security alert
- **Attachments:** None

Conclusion at this stage:  
The alert email itself was **malicious**, and the **domain infrastructure change** warranted deeper investigation.

## 3. Incident Analysis

### Timeline Progression

**September 17, 2024**

- MX record change detected for letsdefwnd[.]io
- Alert raised as early warning

**September 18, 2024**

- A phishing email was observed in Email Security logs
- Campaign escalated from preparation to active exploitation
### Phishing Email Discovery

A search in the **Email Security** tab revealed a phishing email sent one day after the alert:

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|Sender|voucher@letsdefwnd[.]io|
|Recipient|[mateo@letsdefend.io](mailto:mateo@letsdefend.io)|
|Subject|Congratulations! You’ve Won a Voucher|
|Delivery Status|Allowed|
|Timestamp|Sep 18, 2024 – 08:00 AM|


The email leveraged **social engineering and urgency**, enticing the user to click a button claiming a limited-time voucher reward.

### Malicious URL Identified

- **Embedded Link:** hxxp://letsdefwnd[.]io/
- **Contains URL:** Yes    
This confirmed that the impersonating domain was being actively used for phishing.

## 4. URL & Infrastructure Analysis

### OSINT & Sandbox Review

- **VirusTotal (URL):** Initially appeared clean
- **Talos:** Unknown reputation
- **URL resolution:** Intermittent / unstable

Despite mixed OSINT results, further investigation showed **real-world exploitation**, proving the domain was malicious in practice.

### Network & Endpoint Evidence

Log correlation revealed successful communication between the victim endpoint and attacker infrastructure:

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|Source IP|172.16.20.3 (Internal)|
|Destination IP|45.33.23.183|
|Destination Port|25|

- Affected endpoint **contained via EDR**
- Malicious domain and IP **blocked** at perimeter controls
- Artifacts added to IOC watchlists

## 9. Final Assessment

**Verdict:**  **True Positive**  
**Threat Status:** Active phishing campaign confirmed

![](https://i.ibb.co/s9QcBFYn/Pasted-image-20260205154736.png)


What began as an MX record change alert evolved into a **fully executed phishing attack**, validating the effectiveness of early domain monitoring. The attacker successfully delivered a phishing email, convinced the user to click the link, and established communication with malicious infrastructure.

## Lessons Learned

- MX record changes are a **critical early indicator** of phishing campaigns
- Typosquatting remains highly effective against internal users
- OSINT “clean” results do not equal benign activity
- Domain monitoring must be paired with **email and endpoint telemetry**
- User awareness training remains essential
### Analyst Note
On **September 17, 2024**, a Digital Risk Protection alert (**SOC326**) was triggered after detecting a **Mail Exchange (MX) record change** on the domain **letsdefwnd[.]io**, which closely resembles the legitimate **letsdefend.io** domain. The MX record was updated to **mail.mailerhost.net**, indicating that the domain had been configured to send and receive email and could be used for phishing activity.

Initial review of the alert email from **no-reply@cti-report.io** confirmed that the notification itself was informational and did **not contain any attachments or URLs**. However, due to the typosquatting nature of the domain and the presence of an active MX record, the alert was treated as a high-risk early warning indicator.

Further investigation in the **Email Security** logs identified a **phishing email delivered on September 18, 2024**, one day after the alert was generated. The email originated from **voucher@letsdefwnd[.]io** and was sent to an internal user (**mateo@letsdefend.io**). The message contained an embedded hyperlink pointing to **hxxp://letsdefwnd[.]io/** and used social engineering tactics to entice the recipient with a fake voucher offer.

Endpoint and network telemetry confirmed that the user **clicked the malicious link**, resulting in outbound communication to **45.33.23.183**, an IP address associated with phishing and malicious activity based on threat intelligence sources. This confirmed that the impersonating domain was actively weaponized and no longer in a preparatory phase.

The phishing email was deleted, the affected endpoint was contained for further investigation, and the malicious domain and associated IP addresses were blocked at perimeter security controls.
