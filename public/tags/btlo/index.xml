      <description>Scenario&#xA;Recently the networks of a large company named GothamLegend were compromised after an employee opened a phishing email containing malware. The damage caused was critical and resulted in business-wide disruption. GothamLegend had to reach out to a third-party incident response team to assist with the investigation. You are a member of the IR team - all you have is an encoded Powershell script. Can you decode it and identify what malware is responsible for this attack?</description>
