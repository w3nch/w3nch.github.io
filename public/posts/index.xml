            <description>Storing passwords safely is a really important part of running any website or app where people create accounts. When this is done badly, it has led to some of the biggest data leaks ever. Even years later, stolen passwords are still being reused by attackers to break into other accounts.
Below are six common ways passwords have been handled over time, starting with the worst ideas and moving toward safer ones, explained in a simple way.</description>

When this is done badly, it has led to some of the biggest data leaks ever. Even years later, stolen passwords are still being reused by attackers to break into other accounts.</p>
<p>Below are six common ways passwords have been handled over time, starting with the worst ideas and moving toward safer ones, explained in a simple way.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-plain-text">1. Plain Text</h2>
<p>Plain text storage means a password is saved exactly as a person types it. If someone creates an account with a password like <code>hello123</code>, that exact text is stored in the database.</p>
<p><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.next7it.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F05%2FPlain-Text-Password.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=657fa3be1078e3781ca9daf34f8248fb36cfae57c4fe1ad1e3afd7c89c981330" alt=""></p>
<p>This approach was common in the early internet era around <code>1990-2000</code>, when security was not treated as a serious concern. At that time, strong cryptography was either difficult to use or legally restricted. In the United States during the 1990s, encryption was classified as a munition. Exporting strong cryptographic software outside the country could be illegal. This period is often referred to as the <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/12/">crypto wars</a> and is discussed in depth in podcasts like <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/">Darknet Diaries</a>, which explain how many early security disasters happened simply because the internet was not built with attackers in mind.</p>
<p>When passwords are stored in plain text, there is no protection at all. If someone gains access to the database, every password is immediately readable. Nothing needs to be cracked or guessed. Since people commonly reuse passwords across email, social media, and shopping sites, a single breach can spread far beyond the original service.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/14/rockyou-hack-security-myspace-facebook-passwords/">RockYou breach in 2009</a> is one of the most well known examples. Millions of passwords were leaked because they were stored in plain text. Those passwords later became part of <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou-75.txt">wordlists</a> that attackers still use today in credential stuffing attacks. A mistake made more than a decade ago continues to harm users today.</p>
<h2 id="2--encryption">2.  Encryption</h2>
<p>To improve on plain text, some systems began encrypting passwords before storing them. Instead of saving the password directly, the system encrypts it using algorithms such as AES-256 or RSA and stores the encrypted output.</p>
<p><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fasecuritysite.com%2Fpublic%2Frsa_0002.png&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=bd8075c2a4c192392b4ebc86651dadfa5e5499bfb5e55a570fe2b80963c3109e" alt=""></p>
<p>At first glance, this looks secure. The password is no longer readable. However, encryption has one unavoidable requirement. It needs a key.</p>
<p>That key must be stored somewhere so the application can decrypt the password when needed. If an attacker ever gains access to both the database and the encryption key, every password can be decrypted instantly.</p>

-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
</code></pre><p>This has happened in real breaches. Encryption keys have been discovered hard coded in application source code, stored alongside databases, or exposed through backups and cloud misconfigurations. Once the key is compromised, encryption provides little protection.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/vx0gr1Xp/Pasted-image-20260131141814.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://dehashed.com/insights/adobe-data-breach-2013-october">Adobe breach in 2013</a> is a well known example. Adobe used reversible encryption instead of proper password hashing. Once attackers understood how the encryption worked, millions of passwords were exposed. That incident became a major lesson for the industry.</p>
<p>Encryption is designed for data that must be recovered later, such as files or messages. Passwords should never need to be recovered. They only need to be verified.</p>
<h2 id="3-hashing">3. Hashing</h2>
<p>Hashing marked a major improvement. Instead of encrypting passwords, systems began converting them into fixed length values using hash functions. A password hashed with MD5 or SHA-1 cannot be reversed back into the original text.</p>
<p>Early hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, and later SHA-256 were designed to be fast. Their original purpose was file integrity checking, not password protection.</p>
<p>That speed became the weakness. Modern CPUs and GPUs can compute millions or even billions of hashes per second. Attackers simply try large lists of common passwords until they find matches.</p>
<p>Huge databases of precomputed hashes already exit  online like <a href="https://crackstation.net/">CrackStation</a>. If a password appears in one of those lists, it can often be identified almost instantly. This is why many older breaches were devastating even though passwords were technically hashed.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-md5" data-lang="md5">5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
</code></pre><p>Try to find the original text from this.</p>
<h2 id="4-hashing-with-salt">4. Hashing with Salt</h2>
<p>Salting was introduced to fix a major flaw in basic hashing. A salt is a random value added to a password before hashing it. Even if two people use the same password, their stored hashes will be different.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/XfxQq3mx/hahahah.png" alt="">
For example, the password  hashed with SHA-256 will always produce the same result. When a unique salt is added, the output becomes completely different for every user.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-sha-256" data-lang="sha-256">Salt + word + hashing = unique value
</code></pre><p>This change made precomputed hash tables useless and forced attackers to crack each password individually. It significantly raised the cost of attacks and stopped many large scale compromises.</p>
<p>Salting became common after repeated breaches showed that unsalted hashes were too easy to crack. However, if the hashing algorithm is still fast, attackers can continue guessing passwords quickly using modern hardware.</p>
<h2 id="5-slow-hashing">5. Slow Hashing</h2>
<p>To address the speed problem, password specific hashing algorithms were created. These include bcrypt, scrypt, PBKDF2, and Argon2.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/W9q06vZ/Pasted-image-20260130185458.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These algorithms are intentionally slow. Each password guess takes noticeable time and often uses large amounts of memory. This makes brute force attacks expensive and slow, even when attackers use GPUs or specialized hardware.</p>
<p>They also include salting by default and allow systems to adjust the cost factor over time. As computers get faster, systems can increase the difficulty without forcing users to change their passwords.</p>
<p>Most modern applications that take security seriously use one of these methods today. Even if a database is stolen, cracking passwords becomes difficult and sometimes impractical.</p>
<h2 id="6-not-storing-passwords-at-all">6. Not Storing Passwords at All</h2>
<p>The safest password is the one that does not exist.</p>
<p><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmattermost.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F12%2F03_Google_GitHub_Login%402x.png&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=4f5724fa954b529c6cead77d873389c9e7ef808d57996a42aaedef352e9a2699" alt=""></p>
<p>Many modern systems avoid traditional passwords entirely. They use technologies like time based one time passwords, hardware security keys, passkeys built into browsers and phones, or third party authentication providers such as Google or GitHub.</p>
<p>Because there is no password database, there is nothing useful to steal. Old leaked passwords cannot be reused, and phishing attacks become much harder.</p>
<p>This approach does introduce challenges like device loss and account recovery, but when designed properly it removes one of the most common causes of real world breaches.</p>
<hr>
<p>Passwords should never be readable, never reversible, and never easy to guess. Most real breaches are not caused by advanced hacking techniques. They happen because basic design decisions were made years earlier and never corrected. Understanding how password storage evolved explains why modern systems work the way they do today.If you like to read more on this there is a amazin article on <a href="https://dojowithrenan.medium.com/the-5-factors-of-authentication-bcb79d354c13">medium by Renan Dias</a></p>

            <description>Disclaimer: I do not promote hacking or abusing systems without permission. Everything shown here is purely for learning and experimentation.
I was doing what I usually do solving problems on LeetCode using python when a random thought popped into my head:
What if I import os and try to run something on the system?
So I took a basic problem, Two Sum, solved it normally… and then added a tiny extra line at the end.</description>

<h2 id="whats-really-going-on">What’s Really Going On?</h2>
<p>The code is clearly being executed inside a <strong>sandboxed environment</strong>. This is expected online judges like LeetCode <em>must</em> isolate user code. Still, it’s interesting to see how permissive that sandbox is at a basic level.</p>
<p>Now, just to be clear:<br>
I’m <strong>not</strong> attempting any sandbox escape or bypass here. This is just curiosity exploration.</p>
<h3 id="messing-with-runtime">Messing with Runtime</h3>
<p>LeetCode displays runtime metrics, so naturally, I wondered how that value is being calculated. For fun, I tried tweaking the runtime display by changing the execution behavior at exit:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> atexit; atexit<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>register(<span style="color:#66d9ef">lambda</span>: open(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;display_runtime.txt&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;w&#34;</span>)<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>write(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;0&#34;</span>) <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">None</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>basically what this code does is  overwrote <code>display_runtime.txt</code>, result with 0 value and as runtime tries to display it comes out as <strong>0ms</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/QFsjxmxc/Pasted-image-20260129135818.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="should-you-do-this">Should You Do This?</h2>
<p>Absolutely not.
This won’t improve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your problem solving skills</li>
<li>Your algorithmic thinking</li>
<li>Your understanding of data structures
But what it <em>does</em> help with is understanding:</li>
<li>How online judges execute code</li>
<li>How sandboxes are structured</li>
<li>How runtime and metadata might be handled on the backend</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more interesting files in the environment too, if you’re curious enough to look but again, <strong>this is for learning, not abuse</strong>.</p>

            <description>Let me start with the real reason this project exists.
My college keeps giving assignments and insists that they must be handwritten. Not typed. Not PDFs generated from Word. Handwritten and after writing everything, we still have to scan or take photos and upload them to a Google Form.
If you’ve ever done this, you already know how annoying it is.
Writing multiple pages by hand takes time, your hand starts hurting, and half the effort goes into making sure it looks neat enough to upload.</description>

<p>My college keeps giving assignments and insists that they must be <strong>handwritten</strong>. Not typed. Not PDFs generated from Word. Handwritten and after writing everything, we still have to <strong>scan or take photos and upload them to a Google Form</strong>.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever done this, you already know how annoying it is.</p>
<p>Writing multiple pages by hand takes time, your hand starts hurting, and half the effort goes into making sure it looks neat enough to upload. The funny part? The assignment was already written digitally in the first place.</p>
<p>So I did what any tired student who knows a bit of coding would do:<br>
I decided to automate it.</p>
<p><img src="https://c.tenor.com/RSc9Gw10HnsAAAAd/tenor.gif" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="the-idea">The Idea</h2>
<p>The goal was simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Write the assignment normally as text</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convert it into something that <em>looks handwritten</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upload it like everyone else</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No fancy AI. No online services. Just a tool that saves time and sanity.</p>
<p>I wanted it to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fully offline</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easy to use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scriptable from the command line</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-first-attempt-and-why-it-failed">The First Attempt (and Why It Failed)</h2>
<p>Like most people, I first tried libraries that promise “text to handwriting” in one function call. One popular example is <code>pywhatkit</code>.</p>
<p>On paper, it sounds perfect. In reality, it relies on an external API.</p>
<p>That caused problems almost immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn’t</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internet was required</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Random errors like “Unable to access API”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No control over fonts or layout</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/RTDNcM49/2026-01-22-15-12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For something as basic as converting text to handwriting, this felt unnecessarily fragile. If I’m already writing code, I want it to work every time.</p>
<p>So I scrapped that idea.

<h2 id="rethinking-the-problem">Rethinking the Problem</h2>
<p>Instead of thinking “convert text into handwriting,” I changed the way I looked at it.</p>
<p>What I actually needed was this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take text from a file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw it onto a page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a handwriting-style font</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save the result as an image</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>Once you see it this way, the problem becomes much simpler and much more reliable.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-chose-png-instead-of-pdf">Why I Chose PNG Instead of PDF</h2>
<p>At first, PDF seemed like the obvious choice. But PDFs come with annoying font restrictions, especially with decorative or calligraphy fonts.</p>
<p>PNG images are way more flexible:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Almost any font works</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No font embedding issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easy to preview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easy to upload to Google Forms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be converted to PDF later if needed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the college only cares about seeing “handwritten” pages, PNG was more than enough.</p>
<h2 id="the-cli-workflow">The CLI Workflow</h2>
<p>I didn’t want a GUI. I wanted something fast.</p>
<p>The ideal workflow looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Write the assignment in <code>input.txt</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run one command</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get a handwritten image out</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Something like:<br>
txt2hand input.txt output.png</p>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>This makes it easy to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regenerate pages if something changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try different fonts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Batch-convert multiple assignments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automate everything</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-tools-that-made-it-work">The Tools That Made It Work</h2>
<p>Here’s everything the tool actually uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pillow (PIL)</strong><br>
This is the core library. It’s used to create images, load handwriting fonts, and draw text onto a blank page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A handwriting font (TTF or OTF)</strong><br>
Any handwritten-style font works. This gives the output its “handwritten” look. Google Fonts.i used caveat here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it. No APIs. No internet. No background services.</p>
<p>Pillow lets you draw text directly onto an image, and unlike PDF tools, it doesn’t complain about artistic fonts. That meant I could use fonts that actually look like real handwriting.</p>
<p>Once the basics were working, it was easy to add small touches like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Slight text jitter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imperfect line spacing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natural margins</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Those tiny imperfections make a huge difference. Perfect alignment looks fake. Slight messiness looks human.</p>
<p>You can install the only dependency like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>pip install pillow
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="how-the-tool-works-internally">How the Tool Works Internally</h2>
<p>At a high level, the process looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Read the assignment text from a <code>.txt</code> file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a blank A4-sized image</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Load a handwriting-style font</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw each line of text onto the image</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add small random offsets to make it look human</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save the final result as a PNG image</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Simple, predictable, and fully offline. The code can be found on my GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-randomness-matters">Why the Randomness Matters</h2>
<p>If you render text perfectly aligned, it immediately looks fake. Real handwriting has tiny inconsistencies.</p>
<p>That’s why the script adds:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Small horizontal and vertical offsets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natural line spacing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soft margins</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These imperfections make the output feel human instead of robotic.</p>
<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/LhHTWfFc/handwritten-page-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now instead of writing pages by hand, my workflow is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Write the assignment once</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the tool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upload the generated handwritten image</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adjust the values as you like the size , font , color add in more image</p>
<p>from this whole thing the best part?<br>
Other students can use it too.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I know this might not look the best but if it works it work <strong>Don&rsquo;t Touch it</strong></p>
<p>This wasn’t about cheating or shortcuts. The work is still done. The content is still written. The only thing automated is the boring, repetitive part that adds no real value.</p>
<p>If colleges want handwritten submissions but accept digital uploads, tools like this are inevitable.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best motivation to build something isn’t innovation  it’s pure frustration.</p>
<p>And honestly?<br>
My wrist has never been happier.</p>
