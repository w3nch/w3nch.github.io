## Introduction

Docker is a **containerization platform** that allows applications to run in **isolated environments** with their dependencies bundled. Containers share the host OS kernel but are otherwise isolated, providing lightweight virtualization.  

Beyond development and deployment efficiency, **security is critical** because containers, if misconfigured, can become vectors for exploits or lateral movement on the host system.

---

## What is Docker?

Docker allows packaging applications into **containers** that are:

- Lightweight and portable  
- Reproducible across environments  
- Isolated from the host OS  

Key benefits:  

- Predictable environments for development and production  
- Rapid deployment and scaling  
- Easier monitoring and security baselining  

---

## Docker Architecture

Docker uses a **client-server architecture**:

1. **Docker Client:** CLI tool to interact with Docker Daemon  
2. **Docker Daemon (dockerd):** Manages containers, images, networks, and storage  
3. **Docker Registry:** Stores Docker images (Docker Hub, private registry)  

The client communicates with the daemon via REST API, UNIX socket, or TCP.  

---

## Key Docker Components

### Docker Engine

- Core runtime for building and managing containers  
- Handles networks, volumes, and container lifecycle  
- Runs as `dockerd` in background  

**Normal Behavior:** Single daemon running under `root` or a service account.  
**Abnormal Behavior:** Multiple rogue daemons, listening on unexpected ports, or high resource usage.  

---

### Docker Images

- **Immutable templates** used to create containers  
- Built from `Dockerfile` or pulled from registries  

**Normal Behavior:** Stored under `/var/lib/docker/` on Linux  
**Abnormal Behavior:** Unverified or malicious images, modified images without versioning  

---

### Docker Containers

- **Runtime instances of images**  
- Contain isolated filesystem, network, and process space  

**Normal Behavior:** Limited privileges, defined CPU/memory limits  
**Abnormal Behavior:** Running as root unnecessarily, connecting to unknown networks, or persistence after expected lifecycle  

---

### Docker Registries

- Repositories for Docker images  
- **Public:** Docker Hub  
- **Private:** Self-hosted registries  

Security Tip: Always verify **image provenance and signatures**.

---

## Essential Docker Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| docker build | Build an image from Dockerfile |
| docker run | Run a container from an image |
| docker ps | List running containers |
| docker stop/start | Stop or start containers |
| docker exec | Execute command inside a container |
| docker images | List local images |
| docker rmi | Remove images |
| docker logs | View container logs |
| docker inspect | Detailed metadata of container/image |
| docker network ls | List Docker networks |
| docker volume ls | List Docker volumes |

---

## Docker Security Considerations

- **Least privilege:** Avoid running containers as root  
- **Resource limits:** Set memory and CPU quotas  
- **Network segmentation:** Use custom bridge or overlay networks  
- **Secrets management:** Avoid storing credentials in images  
- **Image scanning:** Scan for vulnerabilities with tools like Trivy or Clair  
- **Monitoring:** Track container lifecycle and runtime events  

---

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exploits

Docker can be vulnerable if misconfigured or if images contain exploitable software:

| Vulnerability | Description | Example / Exploit |
|---|---|---|
| Privilege escalation | Containers running as root can escape to host | `docker exec -it <container> /bin/sh` on vulnerable kernel |
| Unverified images | Pulling malicious images from Docker Hub | Malware disguised as `nginx` image |
| Docker socket exposure | Mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` allows full host control | Container accessing Docker API can start privileged containers |
| Container breakout | Kernel exploits allow escaping container isolation | CVE-2020-14386 (runc container escape) |
| Insecure networks | Default bridge network can allow lateral movement | Containers able to sniff traffic of other containers |
| Outdated dependencies | Running outdated software in container | Vulnerable Apache or OpenSSH inside container |

**Example Attack Scenario:**  

1. Malicious container with root privileges is deployed.  
2. Attacker mounts `/var/run/docker.sock`.  
3. Attacker can control all containers and modify host filesystem.  
4. Lateral movement and persistence on host system achieved.  

---

## Mitigations and Best Practices

- Always run containers as **non-root users**  
- Restrict host volume mounts; avoid mounting `/` or sensitive paths  
- Use **read-only filesystems** for containers when possible  
- Enable **seccomp, AppArmor, or SELinux** policies  
- Scan images regularly for vulnerabilities  
- Regularly update the Docker Engine and host kernel  

---

## Baselining Docker Environments

Baselining is critical for monitoring and detecting anomalies in Docker environments:  

- Record expected images, containers, network, and volume configurations  
- Compare live state against baseline  
- Alert on deviations (unexpected images, processes, or open ports)  
- Tools like **Sysdig Falco, Snort, and Prometheus** can help monitor and enforce baseline rules  

**Use Case:** If a container suddenly starts exposing a new network port or mounting `/var/run/docker.sock`, it violates the baseline and should trigger an alert.

**Note:** Understanding Docker architecture, common exploits, and baseline monitoring is critical for DevOps, IT security, and containerized application reliability. Containers offer efficiency but require **strict security hygiene** to prevent compromise.
